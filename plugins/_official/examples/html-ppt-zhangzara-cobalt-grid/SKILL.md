# Cobalt Grid

> Electric cobalt italic serifs on a graph-paper canvas, anchored by stair-stepped pixel-glitch decorations and slim hairline rules.

A single self-contained HTML deck — typography, palette, decorative system,
and slide vocabulary are all tuned together. Mixing layouts across templates
breaks the system; stay inside this one.

## At a glance

- **Scheme:** light
- **Formality:** high
- **Density:** medium
- **Slides in demo:** 8

## Best for

Anything that should feel like a quietly serious design / research bulletin, art publication, or curated trend report. Strong for studio annuals, agency capabilities decks, design-research publications, architecture / art / academic decks, and any deck wanting one strict accent colour and a printed-ledger calmness rather than corporate polish.

## Avoid for

Decks that need warmth, multi-colour energy, or a casual / playful voice — the strict cobalt + cream + grid palette is intentionally austere.

## Workflow

> **Teamver / API mode:** there is no filesystem clone step. Reproduce this
> template with compact inline HTML (and one short body `<style>` / font
> `@import` if needed). Match the `:root` tokens / visual identity from
> `example.html` (palette, fonts, borders, motif density). Emit
> `<artifact type="deck" identifier="deck">` — never `type="text/html"`.
> Do **not** fall back to a sparse Neutral Modern / slate `#0f172a` cover.

1. **Clone `example.html`** into the user's workspace as the working file
   (daemon / local skill runs with tools). In Teamver API mode, skip clone —
   bind the visual kit tokens instead.
2. **Replace placeholder content** with the user's real headlines, body copy,
   numbers, names, dates, and section labels. Match existing dimensions when
   swapping image placeholders.
3. **Preserve the design system.** Never substitute fonts, recolor the palette,
   restructure the layout grid, or strip decorative elements (corner brackets,
   paper grain, geometric shapes, illustrated SVGs). They are part of the
   identity.
4. **Adjust deck length by duplicating layouts.** If the user has more content
   than the demo holds, duplicate an existing slide of the most appropriate
   layout. If less, drop slides from the bottom. Update page-number labels.
5. **Designing missing layouts:** if a slide needs a layout the template
   doesn't have, design it from scratch using the same fonts, palette,
   decorative vocabulary, spacing rhythm, and component grammar — never bail
   to a different template.
6. **Keep the navigation runtime as shipped.** If the deck ships an
   `assets/deck-stage.js` or inline keyboard handler, leave it intact.

## Output contract

Emit between `<artifact>` tags:

```
<!-- Daemon / local skill runs may use type="text/html". -->
<artifact identifier="zhangzara-cobalt-grid" type="text/html" title="Deck Title">
<!doctype html>
<html>...</html>
</artifact>
```

Teamver slide-only API runs must use:

```
<artifact type="deck" identifier="deck">
<!doctype html>
<html lang="ko"><body>…filled slides matching this template's visual kit…</body></html>
</artifact>
```
